3-Input Odd Parity Checker — SystemVerilog (Behavioral, Gate-Level, Dataflow)
This project implements a 3-input odd parity checker using three different modeling styles in SystemVerilog:
1.Behavioral modeling
2.Gate-level modeling (using only NOR gates)
3.Dataflow modeling (using only NAND gates)
Each design includes a dedicated OOP-based SystemVerilog testbench for verification using exhaustive input testing.
